      <h2>Adobe Premier Pro</h2>
      <p> Adobe premiere pro was first introduced to me this year, in the second year of my creative digital media course during a documentary film making module. I have enjoyed learning this program and using it to edit and create different videos. I am currently working on a documentary about an “interesting person”. For this I interviewed my cousin Siobhan who is a fitness influencer from Sowrds living in Bali and working online. Because of the current situation this had to be filmed over zoom, so my challenge was to use B roll and editing to make the interview interesting for the viewer. I interviewed her for an hour and got the footage down to seven minutes. After working on this documentary assignment I am feeling more confident with premier pro and I am excited to use it again to create something. </p>

      <h2>Adobe Audition</h2>
      <p>Adobe audition was first introduced to me this year, in the second year of my creative digital media course during a digital audio module. I have enjoyed learning this program and using it to edit and create different audio. I have used the skills learned in my digital audio module to create a project for a group project module. We decided to create a podcast for our project and used the audio skills and adobe audition skills to do it. I have really noticed myself improve in this module the difference between my first assignment and most recent shows how much iv improved. I also learned a lot about audio and sound that I can implement into other assignments and projects in the future. I am currently working on a radio interview style piece for this module. </p>

      <h2>Adobe Indesign</h2>
      <p> Adobe InDesign was first introduced to me this year, in the second year of my creative digital media course during a visual design fundamentals module and a group project module. I have enjoyed learning this program and using it to edit and create different book designs. I first created a ten-page constructivism style magazine, and I am currently working on a thirty-page project book about the work I have completed throughout my group project module. This has been one of my favorite program to learn I've really enjoyed using it and look forward to using in in the future. </p>

      <h2>Adobe Illustrator</h2>
      <p>Adobe Illustrator was one of the first programs introduced to me in the first year of my creative digital media course during the second semester, we started off learning the basic tool creating and manipulating shapes and lines. I am very proud of what I can create on it now and how good my skills have gotten. It has been one of my favorites programmed to work with so far and I'm excited to see what I can create with it I the future. I have used illustrator to create pieces that were implimented into my website like my logos and background, iv also used it to create my branding for our group project module.</p>

      <h2>Adobe Photoshop</h2>
      <p> Adobe Photoshop was one of the first programs introduced to me in the first year of my creative digital media course during the second semester, we started off learning the basic tool creating and manipulating images. I never enjoyed it as I didn’t have much use for it and found it quite difficult to use. I also haven't used it or needed to use it since then. It is definitely my least favorite of the adobe programs, but I still enjoyed getting to know it and learning a new skill. </p>

      <h2>Adobe Dreamweaver</h2>
      <p>Adobe Dreamweaver was introduced to me in the second year of my creative digital media course during the second semester in a web design module. Before this was introduced to us, we started learning the basics of code on brackets. Coding was daunting at first but after you learn the basics is it fun. Dreamweaver is an amazing program and a lot quicker than typing everything out. We have been using it to create this website which has been one of the most challenging but rewarding assignments to date.</p>
